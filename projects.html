    <p>Okay so I have a fair few projects that from time to time I work on, then forgo and stall - but If I log and blog a bit maybe then some of them will become completed projects 
    with some lessons learned and show cases showable! Not sure what scope and goal of projects to showcase here but I think some thought and planing on the matter should help. </p>
