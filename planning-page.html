    <h1>Planning Page</h1>
    <ul><li><a href="index.html">index</a></li></ul>
    <p>I am thinking that I would like the website to have a bunch of different web designs and layouts, with a recurring button that opens a modal to sort out a universal navigation, maybe I could implement this is a way that there is only one master navigation file with anchor links to the rest of the website. This way I could focus on making web design projects to suit a particular theme really quite comphrensively and still have a way to hop to different projects in order to use this as a way to showcase work to potential clients?</p>
    <p>It might be pretty good to schedule and plan things as they come also - but I am not really too certain how it will all work out but I feel like getting to a point where I can do a little projection as a final task in the day where I make a goal for the next day and then recap on the days goal and if it has been worked on enough?.</p>
