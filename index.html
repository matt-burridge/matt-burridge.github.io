    <p>Hello World!</p>
    <h2>Things to do</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Navi menus</li>
        <p>Could potentially go through some mobile first projects, also should add some ideas and content to practice with, do a deep dive or a refresher in something interesting?.</p>
        <li>Photography portfolio</li>
        <p>Because I now have about 4000 photos but really should get the best ones somewhere I can show people when I let them know that photography is something that I find interesting? Could also make various cat galleries to really hone in on grid layouts</p>
        <li>Coding Lessons</li>
        <p>Because making something teachable is a true way to know it inside out -> but maybe this should be kicked down the road to when I would actually call myself good?</p>
        <li>CopyWriting</li>
        <p>As one thing which I know that I suck at (writing clear and comprehensive english) to make interesting prose, getting to grips with doing independent research and then writing up about it in a sort of salt of the earth free journalism way, becuase I feel like this is something which needs a bunch of practice, it also would be a great oportunity to help make design, typeography and story creation tie into web page design?</p>
        <li>Design and graphics</li>
        <p>I have had a load of practice with drawing and so I really should keep on pumping out the creations when I have the time</p>
        <li>shop and product webpage design</li>
        <p>Because making a good shopping option might get someone to hire me to design websites for them, as in my opinion a functional and trustworthy looking shop is really hard to get right and involves lots of planning, layout and feautures all of which have the frontend as only half the story! as an aside I think I should really get a load of domains from somewhere to do more of the backend things!</p>
        <li>plug in and template creation and tweaking</li>
        <p>Getting familiar with modern web solutions? even if they are there to serve big platforms more than little designers?</p>
        <li>game design and theory</li>
        <p>but remember that what I like to play and enjoy may not be what a 15 year old target demographic likes to play these days?</p>
        <p>It would probably be a neat idea to also try to do a menu system with drop down choices and a breadcrumb navigation that uses php or js so that the actual navi file itself can be a seperate entity? experiement?</p>
    </ul>
